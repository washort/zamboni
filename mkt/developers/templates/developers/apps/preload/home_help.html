You can submit your app to be considered for being <strong>preloaded and
shipped with FirefoxOS devices</strong> by phone operators. To opt-in for
preloading, you may download a test template from us below, test your app,
fill out the template, and upload your results back to us from the <a href="{{
submit_url }}">app preload submission form</a>. We will store your test
results on our servers where they will be reviewed by interested phone
operators. If you have further questions, you can <a href="{{ support_url }}">
